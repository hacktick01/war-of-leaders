## Game Rules

**Objective:** Capture the designated "Capture Point" with either your King piece OR at least 4 of your remaining pieces.

**Materials:**

* 1 General/King
* 2 Captains
* 2 Tanks
* 8 Soldiers 
* 2 Dice
* Measuring tape
* Large table or floor space
* Obstacles (optional)

**Setup:**

1. **Player Count:**  Unlimited 
2. **Play Area:** Decide on the size of the playing area. Players can create obstacles and strategically place their pieces and the Capture Point within this space.
3. **Starting Positions:** Use rock-paper-scissors to determine player order and corner selection. Players then arrange their pieces within their chosen corner.
4. **Movement Factor:** At the start, all players agree on a "Movement Factor" (e.g., 2 inches, 3 cm, etc.). This will multiply the dice roll to determine movement and attack distances.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Turns:** Players take turns in the order decided.
2. **Action Declaration:** At the start of their turn, the player declares "Attack" or "Move". If no declaration is made, it defaults to "Move."
3. **Dice Roll 1:** The player rolls the first dice.
    * **Movement:** 
        * The number rolled is multiplied by the Movement Factor.
        * The player can move any single piece or a group led by a General/Captain this distance in any straight line direction (forward, backward, diagonal), as long as there are no curves.
        * Partial movement is allowed, but any unused movement is lost.
    * **Attack:** 
        * Attacks can only be made on targets within the line of sight.
        * The attack range is the Movement Factor multiplied by 2 (or 3 for Tanks).
        * The player rolls the second dice.
        * Even Result: Attack is successful. The player can remove ONE opponent's piece within the attack range.
        * Odd Result: Attack fails. 

**Winning:**

* The first player to either:
    * Move their King into the Capture Point, OR
    * Move at least 4 of their remaining pieces into the Capture Point

**Encouraged Gameplay Elements:**

* **Strategic Adaptation:** Players are encouraged to change their strategies between games to keep opponents guessing
* **Hidden Information & Deception:** Utilize hidden clues, secret communication (e.g., texting other players), and misinformation to gain an advantage
* **Politics & Negotiation:** Form alliances, make deals, and even betray others to further your own goals

**Key Points:**

* Line of Sight: Obstacles block attacks. Ensure a clear path between the attacker and the target.
* Straight Movement: Pieces can only move in straight lines (including diagonals), no curves allowed
* Partial Movement: Players can choose to move a piece less than the full distance rolled, but any remaining movement is forfeited for that turn
* Full Movement: If a player chooses to move a piece, they must use the entire movement distance rolled or opt for partial movement.
* Free Movement Direction: Pieces can move in any straight line direction, including backward.

**Optional Rules/Clarifications:**

* Terrain: Consider adding rules for different terrain types (e.g., difficult terrain slows movement)
* Special Abilities: You could give the General/King, Captains, or other pieces unique abilities

**Remember:**

* Always use the measuring tape to determine distances.
* Embrace strategic thinking, deception, and negotiation to achieve victory!

## Game Rules

**Objective:** Capture the designated "Capture Point" with either your King piece OR at least 4 of your remaining pieces.

**Materials:**

* 1 General/King
* 2 Captains
* 2 Tanks
* 8 Soldiers 
* 2 Dice
* Measuring tape
* Large table or floor space
* Obstacles (optional)

**Feel free to use non-standard pieces for the game, such as buttons, chess pieces, or any other objects that can represent the different units. The goal is to have fun and be able to play immediately, even with limited resources.** 

While colorful pieces and a nicely laid-out board can enhance the experience, the simplicity of the rules allows for quick and easy setup, ensuring that two players can start a game anytime, anywhere!

**Setup:**

1. **Player Count:**  Unlimited 
2. **Play Area:** Decide on the size of the playing area. Players can create obstacles and strategically place their pieces and the Capture Point within this space.
3. **Starting Positions:** Use rock-paper-scissors to determine player order and corner selection. Players then arrange their pieces within their chosen corner.
4. **Movement Factor:** At the start, all players agree on a "Movement Factor" (e.g., 2 inches, 3 cm, etc.). This will multiply the dice roll to determine movement and attack distances.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Turns:** Players take turns in the order decided at the beginning of the game, moving clockwise around the table.
2. **Action Declaration:** At the start of their turn, a player can declare either "Attack" or "Move". If no declaration is made, their turn defaults to a "Move" action.
3. **Dice Roll 1:** The player rolls the first dice.
    * **Movement:** 
        * The number rolled is multiplied by the Movement Factor.
        * The player can move any single piece or a group led by a General/King or Captain this distance in any straight line direction (forward, backward, diagonal), as long as there are no curves.
        * Pieces must move the full distance rolled or not move at all. 
    * **Attack:** 
        * Attacks can only be made on targets within the line of sight.
        * The attack range is the Movement Factor multiplied by 2 (or 3 for Tanks).
        * The player rolls the second dice.
        * **Even Result:** Attack is successful. 
            * If a Captain is attacked, they are removed from the game and any pieces they were leading now move independently, requiring a separate dice roll for each piece's movement.
            * If the King is attacked, that player is eliminated from the game.
            * Otherwise, the player can remove ONE opponent's piece (other than a King or Captain) within the attack range.
        * **Odd Result:** Attack fails. 

**Winning:**

* The first player to either:
    * Move their King into the Capture Point, OR
    * Move at least 4 of their remaining pieces into the Capture Point

**Encouraged Gameplay Elements:**

* **Strategic Adaptation:** Players are encouraged to change their strategies between games to keep opponents guessing
* **Hidden Information & Deception:** Utilize hidden clues, secret communication (e.g., texting other players), and misinformation to gain an advantage
* **Politics & Negotiation:** Form alliances, make deals, and even betray others to further your own goals

**Key Points:**

* Line of Sight: Obstacles block attacks. Ensure a clear path between the attacker and the target.
* Straight Movement: Pieces can only move in straight lines (including diagonals), no curves allowed
* Full Movement: If a player chooses to move a piece, they must use the entire movement distance rolled or opt not to move at all
* Free Movement Direction: Pieces can move in any straight line direction, including backward.

**Remember:**

* Always use the measuring tape to determine distances.
* Embrace strategic thinking, deception, and negotiation to achieve victory!
